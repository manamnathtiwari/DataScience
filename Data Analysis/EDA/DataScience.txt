Hola Amigo !

Hey This is me the Author yeah ;)
A bit funny not too much though !

Let's Plan the method to become a Data Analyst ;) Lol because its fun . I can think of a data like the number of females in cities and analyse which 
city to visit to have a higher chances of matrimony or more chances of getting a good friend . This is my driving interest to learn Data Analytics .Lol!

Okay so in order too properly learn python first 

Core Python Concepts to learn for data analytics :
1. Jupyter Notebooks 
2. Basic Syntax of Python and some cool concepts like list , dictionary , functions 
3. Numpy Arrays { Creating , indexing ,transposition , shape Manipulation , Conditional Selection , Array Operation Broadcasting }
4. Pandas {Do everything with a csv }
5. Matplotlib and Seaborn 

The above are the really crucial things to know ! (Secret Sauce : They should be like memorized in the brain like songs)

Thats it ! 
Just Kidding !

Need to know some Machine Learing Libraries too ! Some what you need to know 
1. Sci-kit learn
2. TensorFlow 
3. Keras 

Yup That's it is enough to know enough to be somewhat a decent analyst 

Now this  is all your training ; as per ML norms you must now do the testing that is :
1. Do projects on EDA
2. Do atleast 10 Different EDA and analysis project 

Still that was all the training , now you must validate it . So how to ?
step 1 : Pickup real world Dataset 
Step 2 : Automate the Dataset to Clean and Pre-process automatically 
Step 3 : Polish the dataset to give useful insights
Step 4 : Your Analysis must answer any question based on Statistics and other ways
